Description: mitch applies rank-MANOVA to identify differential gene set enrichments in single and multi-profiling data. 
    Multi-profiling data can be multi-omics such as combinations of proteomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, but 
    also high throughput profiling datasets of up to 15 contrasts. mitch imports differential expression data from 
    commonly used tools such as edgeR, limma, DESeq2, ABSSeq and Sleuth as well as scRNA-seq data output by Seurat. 
    mitch can output data in the form of a high resolution PDF or as a self contained HTML report.
